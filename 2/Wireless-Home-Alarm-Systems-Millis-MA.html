We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is developed by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false informs). However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have been activated.
