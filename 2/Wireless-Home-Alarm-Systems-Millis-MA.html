<p>A little more expensive than our winning wise alarm, this system was nearly as simple to install and, throughout testing, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if among the sensing units had actually been set off. We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is developed by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false informs). However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have been activated.
