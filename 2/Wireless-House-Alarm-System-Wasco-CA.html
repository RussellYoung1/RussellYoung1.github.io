<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the precise same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
