<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
