<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
