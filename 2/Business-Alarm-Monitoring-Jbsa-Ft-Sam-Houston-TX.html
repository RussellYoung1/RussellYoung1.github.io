<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational crime avoidance developed to prevent both individual and residential or commercial property crime and can be used in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a particular area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will reduce criminal activity and increase arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other close-by areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
