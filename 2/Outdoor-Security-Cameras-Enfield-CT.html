<p>Thanks to recent advancements in innovation, wireless security systems are now as efficient as wired systems If you have actually made the decision to install an alarm system, you should consider the following advantages of wireless innovation. The $260 Basics package consists of the base station, a keypad, 4 entry sensors, one motion sensor, a lawn sign, and two window decals. For $15 monthly, you can add 24/7 professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can interact with the monitoring service without a landline.
