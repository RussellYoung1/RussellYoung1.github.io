<p>Home security systems and modern-day smart home abilities and compatibilities enable you to tap into their sensors and cameras directly from your phone. Try to find a model that provides a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range up to 25 feet, and affordable cloud storage for tape-recorded video. Often it's practical to be able to see what took place prior to or after a visitor approaches your door. For that, you'll require a doorbell that utilizes pre-buffering to record the action taking place before motion is discovered or the doorbell is pressed.</p>
