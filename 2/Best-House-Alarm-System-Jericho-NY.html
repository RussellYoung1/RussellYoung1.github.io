<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the whole family will love. ADT is a household name, so we regularly try their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task. In our latest round of testing, we recognized that ADT is the most popular provider for a reason. We believe their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint. That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty hectic with awesome wise home features. We especially liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>
