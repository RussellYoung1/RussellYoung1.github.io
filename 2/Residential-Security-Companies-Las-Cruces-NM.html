<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Plus, Amcrest is ONVIF compliant, which implies you can use several different third-party apps, like Blue Iris, and make the camera work with other ONVIF-compliant gadgets.

<p>Geofencing: This function automates motion detection when you return or leave to an established area (usually your home). By doing this, you do not need to keep in mind to switch off the camera's monitoring functions whenever you come home. For this to work properly, every user in the home (including kids) would require the app set up and geofencing allowed on their phones. We also preferred designs that let you disable the automated Away choice.</p>
<p>Analog security cameras send lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we tested, and it offers two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our screening. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And regardless of having an appealing rate and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>
<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the center) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each.
