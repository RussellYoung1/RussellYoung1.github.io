<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 organisations, universities, and government facilities, and residential clients. After looking into 4 various security systems, we chose SSA. They offered us the best description of their services and used us more for the money.

<h3>Outdoor Wireless Camera in Hidalgo TX</h3>
<p>Sensing units allow cameras to start and stop tape-recording based upon time or motion detection. The one time where lag does end up being a little bit of a problem is between recording and identifying movement. It takes a second for the camera to in fact turn on when it detects motion because the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording. They might get past the camera before it had time to tape them if a wicked lawbreaker was quickly enough. Smart phones can also now be utilized to from another location set and unset alarms through apps.</p>

Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>
