However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensing units have been activated.

Wireless security systems are more nimble and integratable, but low signal strength and poor connectivity are still common problems.
