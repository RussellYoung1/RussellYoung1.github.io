The ordinance was modified and went into impact on June 1, 2013.

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

And in action to customer interest and demand, we moved Google Nest Secure into our top five.

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the maker's stats considering that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant culprit for brief battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capability is a bit limited to advise as a top pick.</p>
