<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for renters are their mobility, impermanence and expandability. Renters, unlike property owners, typically prevent making long-term modifications to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other parts can easily be established at different homes in the future, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new parts too. Wireless security plans also allow push-button control of the system and basic home automation.
