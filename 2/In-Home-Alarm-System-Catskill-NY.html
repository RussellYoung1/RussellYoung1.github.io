<p>Almost all wireless home security systems utilize a cellular connection; for that reason, if your web goes down or your power goes out, your security system will still work. Nevertheless, there are still some wireless home security systems that utilize an internet connection as their main communication source. A lot of internet linked security systems include a battery backup, which suggests if the power heads out your alarm will still work for a limited quantity of time. However, if your web goes down, unfortunately, you will lack an alarm up until it comes back up.</p>

<p>Seeing angle: The camera's field of view identifies how much it can see. As you're most likely monitoring a single room, you desire a wide seeing angle. A lot of current cameras fall in the 130-degree variety. These broad angles can in some cases cause image distortion at the edges in the form of a fisheye result, especially when used in smaller rooms, but it's not like you're going to use a security to catch pictures for your picture album.</p>
