<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment by doing this to make customers stay with them longer, since switching monitoring companies implies hundreds of dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for clients. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their most current software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which device was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<p>Frame rate: This is another essential aspect of a camera-- the higher the frame rate, the smoother the video. Video is merely a series of still images sewn together to create a motion picture. The lower the frame rate, the less regularly a still is taken; this results in choppier footage. You'll wish to consider the frame rate of the camera you acquire prior to choosing. For reference, "actual time" is typically determined as 30 frames per second.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with an offered video recorder before purchasing.</p>

Let that sink in for a moment ... these companies do not even utilize the type of cameras they are offering to the general public, and there is a good reason why.</p>
