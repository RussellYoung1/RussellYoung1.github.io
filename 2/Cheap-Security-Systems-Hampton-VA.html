<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later developed to deal with the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly picked words) makes pre-shared essential WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
