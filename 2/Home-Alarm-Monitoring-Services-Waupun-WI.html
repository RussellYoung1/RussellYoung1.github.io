<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal building and construction.

Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
