<p>Discover how to design, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and decrease crime. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image.

The large face of the camera provides you an impressive visual field, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the much better it gets, the more data you'll utilize to save it to the cloud.)

For reference, "real time" is generally determined as 30 frames per second.
