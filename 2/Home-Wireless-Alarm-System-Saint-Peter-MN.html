<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
