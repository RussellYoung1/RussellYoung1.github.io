The arguments for and against CCTV cameras listed below are purely examples of remarks that have actually been discussed, and are not designed to duplicate views from IFSEC International and its group. Modern sensors identify movement indoors and outdoors, listen for the sound of breaking glass to defend against burglars and safeguard belongings. While many people utilize the term CCTV to describe both IP and analog cameras, strictly speaking, the term needs to be limited to describing analog cameras.</p>
<p>Though the majority of our attention these days is concentrated on the transition to IP video technology, it is very important to keep in mind that analog CCTV security cameras can still be extremely reliable for many surveillance applications, specifically those on a spending plan. With standard CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transferred in analog format for local viewing from one main monitoring area. But that doesn't suggest you can't use analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Using IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to leverage your existing analog cameras while migrating into the world of digital surveillance.</p>
