<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
