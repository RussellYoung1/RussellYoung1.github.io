<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, spanning a number of years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually developed into the highly advanced yet inexpensive systems available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to record video and enjoy it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>

Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
