The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to solve information after the reality, which means that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are large and use up a great deal of taping storage area.

Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, however nearly all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is tape-recording. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally focus and still have the ability to see things plainly.</p>
