Due to the fact that everything is simply stuck onto the wall and not hardwired, getting rid of cameras, detectors, and other components of a wireless security system and putting them up in a new location takes minutes, not days.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.

Increasingly more alarm users are returning to smaller local companies to satisfy their alarm security requirements. Lower prices, due to lowered overhead, and direct contact with company owners leads to a boosted sensation of security, quicker and more skilled alarm professionals, and greatly decreased prices.</p>
