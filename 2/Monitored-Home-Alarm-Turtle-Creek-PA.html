The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides free perks like person detection, familiar-face notifies, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 monthly.) However, in our tests the familiar-face informs worked only about half of the camera and the time regularly disconnected from the network numerous times a day (when everything else on our network appeared fine). The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and recorded clips, as well as when we made modifications in the settings.</p>
