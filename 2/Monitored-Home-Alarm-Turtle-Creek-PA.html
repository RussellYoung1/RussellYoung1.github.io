The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces.

The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and recorded clips, as well as when we made modifications in the settings.</p>
