<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
