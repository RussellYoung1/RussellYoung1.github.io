<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
<p>On the surface, these two camera classifications might appear similar, though if you had the ability to see within, the distinctions become unique and apparent. Commercial-grade cameras are designed and built for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not. Normally, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is lots of available light, and once the lighting ends up being low or missing (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Due to the fact that they have larger internal video sensors and higher-quality components that can adjust and capture excellent low light video, commercial cameras outperform their more affordable cousins.</p>

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
