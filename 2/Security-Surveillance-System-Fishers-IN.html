We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for among our top areas.

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.
