<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, because it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
