<p>DITEK's alarm system surge protectors secure your security system versus short-term surges that can go into through Air Conditioning power lines, telephone lines and remote alert zones. Home automation is easy and convenient, and wireless systems help you automate your home that much easier. Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automatic home gadgets are by their very nature wireless, and many home security companies use a home automation plan with an app to remotely control everything on the system. That isn't to state that you can't have wired home automation, because you can, but automated equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and harder to secure. It isn't extremely clever. Wireless gadgets interact more safely and faster to other devices on the system and to the monitoring center (if you pick monitoring).</p>
<p>Some alarm systems are geared up with infrared sensing units that can identify and disregard animals under 40 pounds or so. Having a pet-friendly alarm will help avoid false alarms.
