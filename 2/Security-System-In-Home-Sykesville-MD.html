<p>Just bought a bullet ip system and absolutely love it. Fantastic clarity. I wished to set up viewing on my cellular phone but had a couple questions that the tech addressed with ease. I Would certainly buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter informs, for example. Nevertheless, those functions come at a relatively high price: $5 each month ($50 annually) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 each month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 each year) for 1 month of video history.
