<p>The loudest of the clever alarm systems we evaluated, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at warning anybody in your house and those close-by that there's a problem. Throughout screening, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we love that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be adjusted to represent pets, too.

<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
<p>Ring's non-camera security equipment is still quite new on the scene, so we were cautious in evaluating the brand name's reviews.
