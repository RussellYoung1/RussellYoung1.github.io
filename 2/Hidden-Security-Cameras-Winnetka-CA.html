<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

<p>This awesome wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. Throughout testing, we discovered it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly activating when motion was spotted. We enjoy that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly.
