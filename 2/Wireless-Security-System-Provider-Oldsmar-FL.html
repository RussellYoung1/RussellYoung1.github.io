<p>Ring may not be the most advanced system on our list (Vivint takes that prize), however it sure has acquired rather the fanfare over the years. We have actually been checking Ring Alarm a fair bit lately, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security package that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring charges. Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you choose the totally free self-monitor" choice.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even identify individuals you have actually identified (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>Unlike Nest, TP-Link doesn't make you register for a feature plan to get the most out of the Kasa Webcam Outdoor. By just purchasing the camera, you already get things like customized activity zones, and TP-Link is relatively generous with its complimentary cloud storage (2 days' worth of video history). Audio enhances video surveillance to better discover and analyze events in real-time. As an added advantage, an audio option can be quickly incorporated into the existing security system. The audio feed can be transferred using the same wireless or wired network that transfers the videos - thus enhancing system-wide deployment and distribution options.</p>
