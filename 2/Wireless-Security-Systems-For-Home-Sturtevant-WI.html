With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all connected to one base station or panel to receive sensing units required to manage your equipment including allowing, disabling and sending you instant alerts.

<p>Our burglar alarms might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an infraction. When a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and shutting off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
