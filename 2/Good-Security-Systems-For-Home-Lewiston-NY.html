Retail facilities use video surveillance to monitor client transactions.

<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies every time you stroll by.
