They are also extremely integratable, because wireless systems can be synched up with other home automation functions, such as wise locks and lights.</p>
<p>The Nest Web cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the exact same membership model and very same app as the initial Nest Camera Outdoor, however it includes more-detailed person detection, a brighter image, an automated close-up tracking feature (which follows a person around the seeing area), much better audio, a stronger mount, and a larger operating temperature level variety (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).
