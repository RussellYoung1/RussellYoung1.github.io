During screening, we found it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly activating when movement was detected. We enjoy that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get costly.

<p>Compression: Compression is used to remove unneeded information from the video footage transferred to your video recorder, thereby saving space.

Compression techniques are reasonably complicated and differ in their applications depending on your requirements and hardware. Security Information Watch has developed a helpful guide on compression technology if you're wanting to explore the details of video compression.</p>
