The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
