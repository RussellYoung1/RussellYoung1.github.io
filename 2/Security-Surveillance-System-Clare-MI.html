<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the duty of the whole neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a number of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to store and the length of time you plan to keep documented video footage. The video footage is going to eat up storage area quickly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage once you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not cautious, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>
