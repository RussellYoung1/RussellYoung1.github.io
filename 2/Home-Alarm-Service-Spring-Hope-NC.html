They may declare your security company has failed, that they've taken control of the accounts, which you have to buy new equipment and sign new contracts. Call your existing monitoring company to validate if this happens. Typically, you would be alerted of a modification like this by mail or telephone, not by an unannounced visit by an agent from another company.</p>
