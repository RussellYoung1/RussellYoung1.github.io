<h3>Recommended Home Security Systems in Tennessee</h3>

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
