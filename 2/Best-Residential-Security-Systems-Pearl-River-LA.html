<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
