<h3>Outdoor Security Systems Belmont CA 94002</h3>

However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to effectively discover motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, but it might leave you with taping spaces throughout essential security occasions.
