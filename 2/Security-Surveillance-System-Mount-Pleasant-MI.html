If  authorities are contacted for a false alarm, property owners may have to pay a fine for dispatching cops needlessly. A self-monitored home limitations the capacity for subsequent penalties and false alarms.</p>

Or, if mobile control or video monitoring are your concerns, Link is among the most affordable alternatives.</p>
