In 1997, for example, a top-level authorities official in Washington, DC was captured using police databases to collect details on patrons of a gay club. By searching for the license plate numbers of cars parked at the club and looking into the backgrounds of the automobiles' owners, he tried to blackmail clients who were wed.
