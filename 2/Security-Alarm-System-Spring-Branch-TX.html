<p>Research studies reveal surveillance cameras decrease crime. HD CCTV systems work with standard analog CCTV cameras. If you bought cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable television (take a look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that implies you have traditional analog CCTV security cameras. If you buy HD-CCTV security system, you can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without sacrificing your coax infrastructure. That's just $0.63 a day (or about $19 a month) for the Home Iota All-in-One security camera, an additional contact sensing unit, and a remote key fob. That also consists of complimentary mobile access and 3 days of video storage.</p>

Will they be able to see and tape video efficiently in low-lighting? Are they put with appropriate field of view, or will a PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera be essential? These are all important concerns to be considered when picking security cameras for your CCTV system.</p>
