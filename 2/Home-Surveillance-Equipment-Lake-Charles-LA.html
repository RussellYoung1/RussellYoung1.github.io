<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, vandalism, and theft. Suggestion: Typically keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must once again respond to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of pricey false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically shut off the heating unit. You can instantly make the clever lights turn on to terrify away prospective robbers if the motion sensing units are triggered.</p>

An aid window popped up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint associate helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might inform there was an issue with the circuit board. Definitely not ideal-- but the rep said sorry and shipped her replacement control panel overnight.</p>
