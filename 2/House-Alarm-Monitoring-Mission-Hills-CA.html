Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you walk by.
