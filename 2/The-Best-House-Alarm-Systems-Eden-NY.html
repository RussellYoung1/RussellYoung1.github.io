Maximus Smart Security Light: If you want a subtle security camera, the Maximus Smart Security Light fits the expense. The camera's not especially excellent by itself, however its porchlight exterior will look much better than your other alternatives.

<p>This being Ring, the app is polished and professional too, and if you wish to see what your camera is shooting then you can get the video up on an Echo Program or a Fire TV device with a simple Alexa voice command.
