<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and might even trigger incorrect alarms. False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the cops if they happen frequently enough. Another possible drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working.

<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

Screens can be connected to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to communicate via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
