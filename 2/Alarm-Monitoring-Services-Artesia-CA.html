<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to strive to make a camera with the most difficult setup known to man. Here's how it plays out: First you have to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you go into the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to link to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi details. (You should play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pet dogs growl, felines squeal, babies cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never works.</p>

However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
