<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is an excellent security camera and a sensational value. It receives an Outstanding rating for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.

Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

Regrettably I bought 4 cameras that look much like these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Kid was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is truly great. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
