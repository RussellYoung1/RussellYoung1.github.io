<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
