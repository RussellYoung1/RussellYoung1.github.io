<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to aim to make a camera with the most difficult setup known to man. Here's how it plays out: First you need to download the app and put in your e-mail address.

(You should play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pets howl, cats scream, children weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>
