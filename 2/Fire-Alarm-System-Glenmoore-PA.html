<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were typically missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With standard smart home devices like automatic door locks, you can remain in bed and check that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you keep an eye out for prospective plan burglars or talk with visitors who visit.</p>

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
