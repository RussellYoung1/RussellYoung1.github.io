<p>You might believe you'll never be targeted, however why take the chance? An estimated 2,000,000 thefts occur in the United States every year. Theft avoidance is a needed safety measure to ensure the safety of your possessions. A burglar alarm can serve a number of functions to this end. In some cases, its presence can function as a deterrent-- robbers are less apt to target an area where it is more likely that they will encounter such disturbance. In other scenarios, when they go through with the act, the alarm can serve to alert individuals in the area (in addition to the authorities) that something is awry. This ensures a fast action and reduces the burglar's possibilities of success.</p>

Unlike other monitoring choices, self-monitored systems do not have a regular monthly monitoring fee.</p>
