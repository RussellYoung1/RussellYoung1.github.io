<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
