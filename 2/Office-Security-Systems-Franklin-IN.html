<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's stats given that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant offender for brief battery life without a doubt.

<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a typical camera image. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to solve detail after the fact, which implies that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays.

Compression methods are reasonably complex and differ in their applications depending upon your needs and hardware.
