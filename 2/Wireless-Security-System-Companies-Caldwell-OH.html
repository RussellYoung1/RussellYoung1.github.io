<p>Though most of our attention nowadays is concentrated on the transition to IP video technology, it is essential to note that analog CCTV security cameras can still be highly reliable for many surveillance applications, specifically those on a spending plan. With traditional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transmitted in analog format for local seeing from one central monitoring area. However that doesn't suggest you can't utilize analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Utilizing IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to leverage your existing analog cameras while migrating into the world of digital surveillance.</p>
