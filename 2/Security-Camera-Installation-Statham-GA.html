<h2>CCTV Cameras For Business, School Security Statham</h2>
<p>Ring may not be the most sophisticated system on our list (Vivint takes that prize), but it sure has actually gained quite the fanfare over the years. We have actually been testing Ring Alarm quite a bit lately, and we really like the system for what it is. So what is it?

<p>Simply purchased a bullet ip system and absolutely enjoy it. Excellent clearness. I wanted to set up seeing on my mobile phone but had a couple questions that the tech answered with ease. I Would certainly purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what provides the video history and smarter informs, for example. However, those functions come at a comparatively steep rate: $5 each month ($50 per year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for thirty days of video history.  For each additional camera, the membership is marked down to about half of the initial fee. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 per month for individual detection with one month of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those bumps and functions storage up to 31 days.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is truly terrific.
