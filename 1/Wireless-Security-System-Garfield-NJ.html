<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the exact same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and therefore provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
