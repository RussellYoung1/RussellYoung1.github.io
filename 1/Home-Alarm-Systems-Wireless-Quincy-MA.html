<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you stroll by.
