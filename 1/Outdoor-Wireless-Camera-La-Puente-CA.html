AHD cameras use the same RG59 or RG6 cable television as traditional CCTV cameras. CAT-5 cable with video baluns can also be used. While pro monitoring expenses more, it's more secure.

<p>Another essential subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much suffices.
