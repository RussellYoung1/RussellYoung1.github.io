As with their indoor counterparts, outdoor cameras connect to your Wi-Fi network and enable you to view live video from your phone.

<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we checked, and it uses two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And regardless of having an attractive price and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>
