The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
