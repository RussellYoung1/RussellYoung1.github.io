<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, the majority of burglar alarms work the exact very same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which suggests. If someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system.
