<p>No false alarm penalties: House owners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the police for a false alarm. Given that the homeowner is in charge of the system, police are only called if there's a real emergency.

If  cops are contacted for an incorrect alarm, property owners might have to pay a fine for dispatching authorities unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limitations the capacity for subsequent charges and false alarms.</p>
