<p>Home security systems and modern wise home capabilities and compatibilities allow you to tap into their sensors and cameras straight from your phone. Look for a design that provides a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range as much as 25 feet, and cost effective cloud storage for taped video.

Commercial cameras outshine their less expensive cousins because they have larger internal video sensing units and higher-quality elements that can adapt and record excellent low light video.</p>
