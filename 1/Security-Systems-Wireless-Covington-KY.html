<h3>House Burglar Alarm Covington KY 41011</h3>
<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and a phenomenal value. It receives an Outstanding score for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.

Both are equally prone to false alarms, so it depends upon your individual choice. Quickly pair with Ring Video Doorbells and Ring Security Cams, Alexa-enabled devices and third-party alarm devices for one total system.</p>
