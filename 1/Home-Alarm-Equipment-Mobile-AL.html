You do not want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "people may discover to be cautious about the books and regulars they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang drug addicts, hookers or members."
