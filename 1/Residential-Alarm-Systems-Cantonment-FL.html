<p>B. This chapter governs burglar alarm systems intended to summon cops department personnel, needs registration, evaluation of costs for excessive false burglar alarms, provides procedures for repeat culprits, and supplies an effective date.

While improvements recently have actually made the technology more popular and robust (some systems today have their own unique wireless technology, which can't be disrupted by other signals), concerns continue over vulnerabilities that do not affect hardwired systems.</p>

Aspects we thought about consisted of the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), is there a monitoring plan, can window sensors and door sensors be included, whether the system had a mobile app, can it work with your door locks and can it be integrated into an existing smart home setup, including with voice commands via Amazon Alexa.</p>
