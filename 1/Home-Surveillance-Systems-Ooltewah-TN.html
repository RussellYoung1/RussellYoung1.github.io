<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, due to the fact that it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
