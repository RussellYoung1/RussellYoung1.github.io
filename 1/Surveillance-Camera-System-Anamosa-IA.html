<p>Research studies show surveillance cameras minimize criminal activity. HD CCTV systems are compatible with standard analog CCTV cameras. If you purchased cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable (look at the cord behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable television box) in your existing security system that means you have conventional analog CCTV security cameras. If you buy HD-CCTV security system, you can update your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax infrastructure.
