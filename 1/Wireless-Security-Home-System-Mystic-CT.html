<h3>Best Wireless Home Security System in Connecticut</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the exact same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much wider location and for that reason provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

Unlike other monitoring choices, self-monitored systems do not have a month-to-month monitoring fee.</p>
