<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop.
