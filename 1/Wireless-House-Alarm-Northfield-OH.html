<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage alternative and others do not. For the ones that don't, you are able to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage typically include either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage option saves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This alternative is generally cost-free. A cloud storage option conserves your video in the cloud.
