<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
