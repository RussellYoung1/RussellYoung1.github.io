<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the precise same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
