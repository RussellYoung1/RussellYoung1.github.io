We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is developed by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect signals). Nevertheless, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensors have been activated.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
