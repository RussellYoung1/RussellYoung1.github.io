<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is an excellent security camera and an extraordinary value. It receives an Outstanding rating for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for additional cloud storage.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features.
