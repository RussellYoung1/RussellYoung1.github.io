<p>While monitored systems are more extensive and do most of the work for you, an unmonitored system relies on somebody responsible (we're taking a look at you) to help do some of the work. You can normally install these systems by yourself, and they are much, much less expensive. Also, there's no fear of entering into an agreement you can't leave when you need to. The financial independence alone makes this choice much better for some households. Additionally, most unmonitored security systems will send out notifies to your smartphone, making it easy to know if there's a threat to your home.</p>
