<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. Audio and video verification techniques use cameras and microphones to record audio frequencies, video signals, or image snapshots. The source audio and video streams are sent over a communication link, usually a Web protocol (IP) network, to the main station where monitors recover the images through proprietary software application. The details is then relayed to police and tape-recorded to an event file, which can be utilized to prepare a more tactical and strategical approach of a residential or commercial property, and later on as prosecution proof.</p>
