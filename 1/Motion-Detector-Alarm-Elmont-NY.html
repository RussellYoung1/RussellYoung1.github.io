<p>Discover how to design, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and minimize criminal offense. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with terrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was defective, and so we might review this review.
