<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical given that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers realize that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
