<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the producer's stats because this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest offender for short battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capability is a bit minimal to suggest as a top pick.</p>
<p>If you have a bigger home or property you want to keep an eye on, SimpliSafe may be too restricted for you.
