<p>Nest Secure provides loads of wise gadgetry-- a lot so that you may get overwhelmed by all of the alternatives. However hey, Nest is owned by Google, so we 'd expect nothing less! We really delighted in utilizing Nest Secure for home protection and automation, but keep in mind that it can get expensive if you do not currently have a Nest smart home community installed.

Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I evaluated, including clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. But the Secure is costly, additional sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not include fire alarms or camera backups-- is also expensive if you do not commit to a three-year agreement.</p>
