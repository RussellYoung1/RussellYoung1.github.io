<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable on its own.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions.
