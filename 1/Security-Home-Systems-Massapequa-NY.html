<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>

The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides seven days of complimentary cloud storage (with more offered for a month-to-month charge ).
