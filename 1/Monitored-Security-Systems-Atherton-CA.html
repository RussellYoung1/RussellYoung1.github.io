<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the obligation of the entire neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you mean to keep and how long you plan to keep taped video. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage area quickly.
