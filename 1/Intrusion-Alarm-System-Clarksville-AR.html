<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
