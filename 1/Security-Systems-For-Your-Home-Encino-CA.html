<p>Pelco uses video surveillance cameras and video management options for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping centers, hotels, and others. IP cameras work by using an IP (IP means internet procedure) network, often the exact same information network the rest of a company utilizes. A separate network utilizing classification 5 electrical wiring can be used if bandwidth is an issue.
