Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I tested, consisting of clever things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.

With a lot of Do It Yourself systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Package, the Ring Alarm Security Package, and the Nest Secure, you purchase the hardware outright and can avoid any monthly charges if you decide to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, charges will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 each month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month.
