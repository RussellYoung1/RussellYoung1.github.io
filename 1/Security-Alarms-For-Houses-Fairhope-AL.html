<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days.

To recoup costs and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company should be certified, pay any registration or false alarm charges, and supply physical evidence like camera video or a broken window to warrant authorities reaction.</p>
