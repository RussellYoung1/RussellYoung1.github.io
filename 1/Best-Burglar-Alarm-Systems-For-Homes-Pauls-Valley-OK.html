With those kinds of statistics, it is no surprise home security systems are on individuals's minds. But in a world where innovation seems to progress on a monthly basis, home security systems have actually ventured into new territory: smart alarms.</p>
<p>One of the best aspects of this alarm system is that it has a very innovative motion sensor. It just gets activated when a human comes in close distance due to the fact that it uses infrared sensors and mass detection to differentiate between individuals and other inanimate items or smaller sized living things. If your motion sensing unit is triggered, you get an alert in your smartphone app. There's no latency so you get notified instantly so you can take immediate actions such as triggering a loud alarm, getting in touch with the authorities, or using the camera's two-way audio system to talk with the potential burglars.</p>

<p>Door and window sensing units are contact motion sensing units that trigger an alarm when the secured door or window opens.
