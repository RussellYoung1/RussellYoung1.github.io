With those kinds of statistics, it is no surprise home security systems are on individuals's minds. But in a world where innovation seems to progress on a monthly basis, home security systems have actually ventured into new territory: smart alarms.</p>
<p>One of the best aspects of this alarm system is that it has a very innovative motion sensor. It just gets activated when a human comes in close distance due to the fact that it uses infrared sensors and mass detection to differentiate between individuals and other inanimate items or smaller sized living things.

<p>Door and window sensing units are contact motion sensing units that trigger an alarm when the secured door or window opens.
