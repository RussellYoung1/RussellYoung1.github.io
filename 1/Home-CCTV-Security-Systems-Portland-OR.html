<p>The loudest of the wise alarm systems we evaluated, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at warning anybody in your house and those nearby that there's a problem. Throughout testing, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we like that the sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adapted to account for pets, too. The alarm is just one of 2 we checked that consists of an external siren, and we're amazed that it likewise comes with a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, further dissuading anyone from trying to break in to your home.
