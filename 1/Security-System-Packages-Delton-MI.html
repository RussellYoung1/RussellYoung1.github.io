<p>CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a fantastic security camera and an extraordinary value.

The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
