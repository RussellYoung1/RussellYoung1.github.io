<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a great security camera and a sensational worth. It receives an Outstanding ranking for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage.
