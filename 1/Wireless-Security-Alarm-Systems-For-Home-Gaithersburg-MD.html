However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensing units have been activated.

<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal activity prevention created to avoid both individual and home crime and can be used in place of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer images of a specific area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will minimize crime and boost arrest, without displacing crime to other close-by areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
