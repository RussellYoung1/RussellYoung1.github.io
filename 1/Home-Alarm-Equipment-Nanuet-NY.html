In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal security guard. A number of cities likewise require a permit to even run a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are created to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>
