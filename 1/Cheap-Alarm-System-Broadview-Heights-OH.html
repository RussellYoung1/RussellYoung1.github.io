<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
