<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a kind of situational criminal activity avoidance created to prevent both individual and property crime and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, cops.

This action combined with an electrical present (usually at 12V DC) allows an alarm control board to detect a fault on that zone or circuit. These kind of sensors are extremely typical and are discovered either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can usually be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
