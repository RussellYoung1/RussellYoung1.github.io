High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT offer only professional installation. But most other companies on our best home security systems list offer you a DIY choice. ADT doesn't have the strongest customer care reputation amongst the companies we thought about, acquiring more than 3,000 complaints on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked the majority of this as much as the reality that ADT has numerous million more clients than its rivals, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>
