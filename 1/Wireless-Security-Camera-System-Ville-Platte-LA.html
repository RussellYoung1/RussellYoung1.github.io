<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community should take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer thefts across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. However, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to authorities capability to capture intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by police and whole communities (all taxpayers support cops response to alarmed homes) a pricey and inefficient  method to burglary reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
