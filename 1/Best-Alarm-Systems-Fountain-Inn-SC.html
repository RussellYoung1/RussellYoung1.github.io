Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

Location sensing is extremely helpful as it can tell when you get home or leave (using your phone's GPS) and turn alarms and camera on or off appropriately.
