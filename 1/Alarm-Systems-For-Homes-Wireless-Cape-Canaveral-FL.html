<p>There are two primary types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet procedure (IP) cameras and the standard analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern-day model of analog cameras, and while the individual cameras tend to be a little more expensive, they offer a variety of features that analog cameras do not.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later produced to resolve the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared essential WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
