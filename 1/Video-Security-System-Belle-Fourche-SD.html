<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical since the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers understand that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
