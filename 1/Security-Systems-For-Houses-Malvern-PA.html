<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
