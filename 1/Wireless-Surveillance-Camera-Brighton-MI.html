With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be taken into consideration. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal.

<h3>Burglar Alarm Monitoring in Brighton MI</h3>
<p>When I speak about my work with homeland security surveillance and physical security innovations, I typically get the Big Bro is viewing" comment, referring to George Orwell's universal socialistic watcher called Big Sibling in his book 1984. This Orwellian" worry is that somebody someplace might be enjoying you through a video surveillance camera this very minute and that somebody somewhere is abusing the system to break your liberty and privacy.

Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
