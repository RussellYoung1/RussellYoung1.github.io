<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, ought to supply at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more offered for a monthly cost ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to appropriately identify motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, but it may leave you with recording spaces during essential security occasions. If home security is your main concern, we 'd recommend one of our top choices, but the Arlo is terrific for signing in on household and pets-- or roaming cats sliding around your backyard.</p>
