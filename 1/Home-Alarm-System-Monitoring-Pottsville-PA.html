When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later on produced to resolve the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any client in the network that knows the secrets can check out all the traffic.</p>
