<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
