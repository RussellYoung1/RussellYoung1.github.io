<p>Nurse calling systems generally consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's restroom. He can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station if a client is having trouble. This is a simple switch that is generally open or usually closed. Most of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and signals, sensing units, access control, and so on. My mind conceived a method of not just providing the client with the patient-monitoring system but incorporating it into their old nurse call station system.</p>
