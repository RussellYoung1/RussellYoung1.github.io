<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
