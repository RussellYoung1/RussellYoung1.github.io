<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security specialists looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for one of our top spots. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape approximately 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were typically missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard smart home devices like automated door locks, you can stay in bed and check that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you keep an eye out for would-be package burglars or speak to visitors who come by.</p>

By just buying the camera, you currently get things like custom-made activity zones, and TP-Link is fairly generous with its free cloud storage (2 days' worth of video history). Audio augments video surveillance to much better identify and interpret occurrences in real-time. As an added benefit, an audio option can be quickly incorporated into the existing security system.
