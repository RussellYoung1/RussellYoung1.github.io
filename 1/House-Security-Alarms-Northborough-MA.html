<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the community must carry a share of the cost. If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer thefts across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. However, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by authorities and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers support authorities response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and pricey technique to break-in decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
