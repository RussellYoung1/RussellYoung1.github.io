<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your family and home. The foundation of a home security system is the base station. This system is what interacts with all of the security sensing units and smart-home elements in your house. Many connect to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular assistance, placement is more versatile. Contact sensing units are the first thing you must buy alongside the base station; these connect to windows and doors and will inform you when they open.

Just a couple years earlier, the home security industry was controlled by a couple of huge names using expensive, stiff plans with little flexibility and hostile, long-lasting agreements.
