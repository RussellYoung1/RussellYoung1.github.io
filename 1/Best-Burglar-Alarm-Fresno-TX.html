<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, vandalism, and fraud. Idea: Frequently keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed.

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal performance.
