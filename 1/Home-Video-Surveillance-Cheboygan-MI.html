(For a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The very best Wi-Fi Router (for Many People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good general rule that if your smart device or laptop computer gets good Wi-Fi reception in the area you wish to install the camera, you likely won't have a problem.</p>

There's no latency so you get informed instantly so you can take immediate actions such as setting off a loud alarm, calling the authorities, or using the camera's two-way audio system to talk to the possible intruders.</p>
