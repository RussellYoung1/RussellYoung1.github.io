<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood ought to shoulder a share of the cost.

However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to police ability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers support authorities action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and expensive approach to theft decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
