<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, dealing with advanced wise home connoisseurs or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.
