<h3>Best Wireless Home Security System  in Mississippi</h3>

Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
