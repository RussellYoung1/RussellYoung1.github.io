<p>CCTV cameras are better at catching wrongdoers after they have actually devoted a crime, instead of having the ability to stop a criminal activity in progress. Someone has to be actively viewing the video screens for all 10,000 cameras if they are going to attempt to detect criminal activity before it occurs. Having a a great deal of visible CCTV cameras in public locations might work as some level of deterrent, understanding you are being filmed, though probably not watched.</p>
