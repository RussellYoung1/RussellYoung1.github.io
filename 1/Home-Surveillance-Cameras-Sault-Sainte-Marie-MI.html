<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and individuals, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even determine individuals you've identified (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
