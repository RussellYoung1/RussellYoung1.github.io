<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, accommodating sophisticated clever home fanatics or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I checked, including smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.

<p>Numerous home security systems are managed by smart devices and that trend will continue. Systems will have fewer wall-mounted keypads, and rather, offer more controls to more devices. Wireless door, window, glass break, water, freeze and motion sensors communicate with a hub or base station in your house. The main control needs to be centrally located in your house and have full time non-switched AC power. Wired alarm systems are extremely trusted and you don't have to worry about their battery going out. However, they are fixed in location, may need expert installation, and they're not portable.</p>
