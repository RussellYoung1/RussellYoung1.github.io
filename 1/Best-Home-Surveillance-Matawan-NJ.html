<p>Thanks to recent improvements in technology, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you have actually decided to install an alarm system, you must consider the following advantages of wireless technology. The $260 Basics package consists of the base station, a keypad, four entry sensing units, one motion sensing unit, a backyard sign, and two window decals. For $15 monthly, you can add 24/7 expert monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive strategy adds control through iOS and Android mobile phone apps, push and e-mail alerts, and 30-day event-footage storage for endless cameras, consisting of the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is available independently.
