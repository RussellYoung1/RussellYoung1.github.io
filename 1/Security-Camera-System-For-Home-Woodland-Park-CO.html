Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
