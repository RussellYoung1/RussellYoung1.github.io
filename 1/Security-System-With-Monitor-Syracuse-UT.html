<p>We still believe the Ring Alarm is a great alternative for a cheap home security system with smart home assistance. However perhaps avoid the cameras in the meantime. Hard disk drive storage is safe, secure, and convenient, with many systems offering growth and complimentary cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll need to manually get rid of to move the information? Does it go to your smartphone, or upload to services like Dropbox? For the greatest security, you desire the information to be backed up in several places. Another element is how many days of footage are archived.

A lot, in fact, that they require about four times the disk drive area of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage. If extended video storage is important, be prepared to invest more cash.</p>
