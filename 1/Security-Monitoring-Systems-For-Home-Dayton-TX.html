<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
