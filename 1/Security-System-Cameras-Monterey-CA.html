<p>DITEK's alarm system rise protectors secure your security system versus transient surges that can enter through Air Conditioner power lines, telephone lines and remote alert zones. The Piper NV is most importantly a camera. It uses night vision and a wide-angle view so you can utilize one camera to monitor a large space.

It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even identify people you've labeled (after a knowing period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
