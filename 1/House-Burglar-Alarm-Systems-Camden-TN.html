<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or home is the obligation of the entire community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a number of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you intend to store and the length of time you prepare to keep recorded video. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage area rapidly.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
