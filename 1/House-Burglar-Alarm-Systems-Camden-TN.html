Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a number of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you intend to store and the length of time you prepare to keep recorded video.

There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
