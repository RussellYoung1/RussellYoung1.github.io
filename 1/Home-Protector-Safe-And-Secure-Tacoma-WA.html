Secure Your Home requires expert equipment installation but the good news is the installation fee is already included in the upfront package costs.

<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, catering to advanced wise home aficionados or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I checked, including clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. However the Secure is expensive, extra sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also pricey if you do not devote to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>Ping Camera - This desktop camera works for home security and staying in touch with relative. For instance, your kid can call your cellphone by pushing a button on the camera.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features.
